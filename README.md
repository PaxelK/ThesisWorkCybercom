This is a master thesis work in smart cities, specifically Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The focus is on energy management of WSN by determining cluster heads (CHs) with a proposed modification of the LEACH protocol and controlling the packet rate of the CHs as well as the movement of a mobile sink. Note that the movement of the sink is controlled with a model based controller, namely MPC, as well as a data based controller, namely reinforcement learning.
